## Flexible Penalized Convolutional Non-negative Matrix Factorization (fpCNMF)
This package includes MATLAB implementations of algorithms for using CNMF to discover and cross-validate spatiotemporal motifs in large-scale neural imaging data. It leverages adaptations of previously published algorithms (see below) to address the challenges of fitting high dimensional imaging datasets. 

If you use this package in published work, please cite our work and the amazing work of those that developed the original algorithms (detailed below).

Previously published algorithms:

pMU_CNMF: penalized multiplicative CNMF, based on the (amazing) seqNMF toolbox from (https://github.com/FeeLab/seqNMF)

ANLS_CNMF: alternative non-negative least square CNMF. MATLAB implemenation from (https://github.com/degleris1/CMF.jl)

PhenoCluster: unsupervised clustering algorithm, based on (https://github.com/jacoblevine/PhenoGraph)
