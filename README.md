# fpCNMF
Flexible Penalized Convolutional Non-negative Matrix Factorization (fpCNMF).  This package includes MATLAB implementations of algorithms for discovering and cross-validating spatiotemporal motifs in large-scale neural imaging data.  Implementations of previously published algorithms (e.g. penalized mulitplicative update CNMF and PhenoCluster) have been adapted to be optimized for the challenges of high dimensional imaging datasets.    If you use this package, please cite our work and the amazing work of those that developed the indivdiual algorithms. Specific credit is detailed in individual functions.   Our work: MacDowell and Buschman,   pMU_CNMF: penalized multiplicative CNMF, based on the (amazing) seqNMF toolbox  ANLS_CNMF: alternative non-negative least square CNMF. MATLAB implemenation of  PhenoCluster: unsupervised clustering algorithm, adapted from XX.   NOTE: this package is currently under development. Please feel free to reach out to camdenm@princeton.edu if you have any questions.
